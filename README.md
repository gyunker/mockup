#Second Idea - Flash Cards: Learning Resource(s) / Tool(s)
1. As a visitor, I would want to create an account
2. As auser, I would want to create a learning asset (flash card)
3. As a user, I would want to create an grouping of learning assets (deck of cards)
4. As a user, I would want to flag known learning assets (Cards I already know)
5. As a user, I would want to flag difficult learning assets (Cards i struggle with)
6. As a user, I would want to save learning assets in order to retrieve them later
7. As a user, I would like to determine publishing settings on my learning assets (share with friends)
8. As a user, I would like to view other learning assets.
9. As a user, I would like to find my friends (i.e. Facebook) that are also using this web app.
